#### Springfield M1A Socom II
The Socom II has a quad-rail that will allow you to mount whatever accessories your application requires. Maybe you need a light, laser or vertical foregrip – there’s ample space for all of these. Co-witnessed night vision and low-magnification optics are commonly found on rifles in this class, and the extended rail option gives you plenty of room for this. The SOCOM II has the same specially-engineered 16 inch barrel and proprietary muzzle brake as the SOCOM 16, so you can expect the same excellent recoil reduction and low muzzle rise. The two-stage military trigger and fast acquisition sights – a ghost ring rear aperture and XS Tritium front sight – are more features that make the SOCOM II a great choice for a tactical rifle.
