#### Benelli 828U
A shotgun that feels and shoots like a Benelli from the moment you pick it up to the moment you break it open. When innovation and inspiration collided the 828U was born – the first over/under worthy of the Benelli badge. With the strength of steel and the weight of aluminum, the 12-gauge 828U has redefined the category. The 828U features a Patented steel locking system and plate, Easily removable trigger group receiver, Adjustable drop and cast, Ergonomic opening lever, Impulse activated ejectors. From butt to barrel, there is nothing about the 828U that hasn’t been rethought and improved.
